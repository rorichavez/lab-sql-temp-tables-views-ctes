# Step 1: Create a View
-- summarizes rental information for each customer. 
-- Should include: customer's ID, name, email address, and total number of rentals (rental_count).

#Step 2: Create a Temporary Table
-- That calculates the total amount paid by each customer (total_paid). 
-- Should use the rental summary view created in Step 1 to join with the 
-- payment table and calculate the total amount paid by each customer.

# Step 3: Create a CTE and the Customer Summary Report
-- That joins the rental summary View with the customer payment summary Temporary Table created in Step 2. 
-- Should include the customer's name, email address, rental count, and total amount paid.
-- Create the query to generate the final customer summary report, which should include: 
-- Customer name, email, rental_count, total_paid and average_payment_per_rental, 
-- this last column is a derived column from total_paid and rental_count.
